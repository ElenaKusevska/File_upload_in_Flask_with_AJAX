Geothermal energy is a sustainable baseload source recognized for its ability to provide\\n\\nclean energy on a large scale. Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS)—offer promising prototypes—\\n\\nemploy a closed-loop vascular layout that runs deep beneath the Earth’s surface. A working fluid\\n\\n(e.g., water or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)) circulates through the vasculature, entering the\\n\\nsubsurface at the inlet and exiting at the outlet with an elevated temperature. For designing and\\n\\nperforming cost-benefit analysis before deploying large-scale projects and maintaining efficiency\\n\\nwhile enabling real-time monitoring during the operational phase, modeling offers cost-effective\\n\\nsolutions; often, it is the only available option for performance assessment. A knowledge gap exists\\n\\ndue to the lack of a fast predictive modeling framework that considers the vascular intricacies,\\n\\nparticularly the jumps in the solution fields across the channel. Noting that the channel diameter is\\n\\nconsiderably smaller in scale compared to the surrounding geological domain, we develop a reduced-\\n\\norder modeling (ROM) framework for closed-loop geothermal systems. This ROM incorporates the\\n\\njump conditions and provides a quick and accurate prediction of the temperature field, including the\\n\\noutlet temperature, which directly correlates with the power production capacity and thermal draw-\\n\\ndown. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the framework by establishing the uniqueness\\n\\nof the solutions and reporting representative numerical solutions. The modeling framework and the\\n\\npredictions reported in this paper benefit the closed-loop geothermal community, enabling them to\\n\\ndetermine the system’s performance and optimal capacity.\\n\\nA LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nAGS advanced geothermal system\\n\\nBC boundary condition\\n\\nEGS enhanced geothermal system\\n\\nIBVP initial boundary value problem\\n\\nROM reduced-order model\\n\\nKey words and phrases. reduced-order modeling; geothermal energy; closed-loop systems; transient response;\\n\\nthermal efficiency; boundary conditions.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\\n\\nC\\nonventional energy sources—originating from fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and nat-\\n\\nural gas—come with various drawbacks. First, the dwindling availability of these natural\\n\\nresources poses a threat to our long-term energy sustainability. Second, scientists recognize that en-\\n\\nergy production reliant on fossil fuels significantly contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases,\\n\\nwidely acknowledged as a critical factor in driving climate change [Friedlingstein et al., 2022; Han-\\n\\nnah et al., 2020]. Third, extracting, processing, and using these fossil-based energy sources pollute\\n\\nthe environment [Evans et al., 2009]. Therefore, delving into alternative energy technologies and\\n\\nprogressively transitioning towards a sustainable, low-carbon energy future is imperative.\\n\\nClean energy enables this transition. Often called renewable or green energy, it encompasses\\n\\nenergy sources and technologies with minimal adverse environmental effects compared to traditional\\n\\nfossil fuels. The principal aim of clean energy is to decrease carbon emissions into the atmosphere.\\n\\nSome popular clean energy forms include solar, wind, hydrogen, and geothermal energy [Jaiswal\\n\\net al., 2022]. Among these clean energy alternatives, geothermal energy has emerged as a reliable\\n\\nrenewable resource, capable of providing base load power during both peak (day) and off-peak\\n\\n(night) times [Falcone et al., 2018].\\n\\nSeveral factors make geothermal energy truly reliable and sustainable:\\n\\n(1) The Earth possesses extensive reserves of thermal energy: its core produces a power of\\n\\napproximately 40 TW [Johnston et al., 2011; Stober and Bucher, 2021]. According to the\\n\\nWorld Energy Council (WEC), the Earth’s crust alone holds a total energy of 5.4× 1027 J\\n\\n[Kumari and Ranjith, 2019]. A mere 0.1% of this energy could meet the planet’s energy\\n\\ndemands for 2000 years, considering the current global energy demand of 2.7 × 1021 J\\n\\n[Bertani, 2012].\\n\\n(2) Geothermal energy excels in environmental friendliness, leading with a score of 7.23/10\\n\\nfor minimal air pollution among clean energy options [Dincer and Acar, 2015].\\n\\n(3) Advancements in drilling technology, primarily from the hydraulic fracturing boom, enable\\n\\nthe boring of vertical and horizontal channels spanning miles [Bertani et al., 2018]. This\\n\\nflexibility in drilling makes geothermal energy competitive, as the amount of available\\n\\nthermal energy increases with depth.\\n\\n(4) With the technical know-how gained from various case studies [Mohamed et al., 2021], the\\n\\nability to predict drilling fluids’ rheology [Nasiri and Ashrafizadeh, 2010], and the avail-\\n\\nability of anti-sagging agents combined with novel drilling techniques [Elkatatny, 2019],\\n\\nachieving intricate channel layouts is possible and economical.\\n\\nBecause of these favorable characteristics and technological developments, as of 2016, twenty-six\\n\\ncountries across the globe use geothermal energy to generate electricity [Bertani, 2016].\\n\\nCurrently, there are two prominent geothermal prototypes that are scalable: Enhanced Geother-\\n\\nmal Systems (EGS) and Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS). A typical EGS comprises two par-\\n\\nallel channels, an injection well and a production well, extending deep into the Earth’s subsurface,\\n\\nspanning orders of kilometers [Olasolo et al., 2016; Ricks et al., 2024]. The process involves injecting\\n\\nwater into the subsurface through the inlet channel. This water then navigates through fractures in\\n\\nhot rock formations, ultimately exiting via the outlet channel. Along this flight, the water absorbs\\n\\nheat and exits the subsurface at an elevated temperature [Norbeck et al., 2018]. The resulting\\n\\nhot water or steam can then be harnessed for either household heating or electricity generation.\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the injected water could enhance permeability by reopening pre-existing fractures, it can\\n\\nalso risk triggering seismic activity [Breede et al., 2013; DOE, 2012; Kaieda et al., 2010].\\n\\nConsequently, AGS, a closed-loop geothermal system, effectively harnesses energy from deeper\\n\\nhot rock layers and low-permeable regions without induced seismicity [Amaya et al., 2020; Horn\\n\\net al., 2020]. AGS operates by circulating a working fluid from the surface through a network of\\n\\nchannels without resorting to reservoir stimulation, thereby reducing seismic risks [Malek et al.,\\n\\n2022; Yasukawa, 2021]. AGS involves pure conduction with limited contact with the rocks, resulting\\n\\nin lower thermal conductivity. This characteristic leads to a gradual replenishment of thermal\\n\\nenergy, ultimately ensuring sustained high thermal performance [Cheng et al., 2013; Wang et al.,\\n\\n2021]. A full-scale demonstration project called Eavor-Lite in Alberta, Canada has been operating\\n\\nsince 2019 [Toews and Holmes, 2021], and the first commercial closed-loop project called Eavor-\\n\\nloopTM is recently initiated in Germany [Longfield et al., 2022]. An exponential growth in various\\n\\nstudies and numerical investigation on AGS is seen from 2001 through 2021 [White et al., 2024].\\n\\nRecognizing the advantages and recent advancements [White et al., 2024], our study focuses on\\n\\nmodeling closed loop systems.\\n\\nGiven the intricate subsurface processes within a geothermal energy system, the utilization\\n\\nof modeling tools is indispensable. Various concomitant strategies encompass economic modeling\\n\\n(including cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory changes), sustainability analysis,\\n\\nreservoir modeling (e.g., focusing on geological aspects like faults), integration with power systems,\\n\\ntechnology developments (e.g., drilling advancements), and heat extraction modeling (e.g., encom-\\n\\npassing well-bore modeling and thermodynamics models) [Beckers and Johnston, 2022; Böttcher\\n\\net al., 2016; Esmaeilpour et al., 2021; Malek et al., 2022; Watanabe et al., 2017]. This paper\\n\\nexplicitly addresses the last aspect of modeling.\\n\\nThe complexity of a model depends on the specific processes and physical scales one seeks to\\n\\ncapture. In the case of heat extraction modeling of a geothermal system, if one wants to resolve the\\n\\nfluid transport within the vasculature, one must use the so-called conjugate heat transfer, which\\n\\ncouples the flow dynamics of the fluid (i.e., coolant) and heat transfer in the host solid and fluid\\n\\n[Zhang, 2013]. However, when the goal is to forecast temperatures in the subsurface and at the\\n\\noutlet, employing a reduced-order model will suffice. The choice is justified, as the diameter of\\n\\nthe bore-hole is 0.3m while the depth that the vasculature extends is of order tens of kilometers.\\n\\nConsequently, it is reasonable to assume the vasculature behaves as a curve within the domain. This\\n\\nassumption enables the development of a simplified mathematical model that accurately predicts\\n\\nthe outlet temperature and temperature field in the subsurface. Therefore, we present a reduced-\\n\\norder modeling strategy for closed-loop thermal regulation systems that offers fast forecasting of\\n\\ntemperature fields, especially the outlet temperature.\\n\\nTo advance modeling efforts and attain a deeper understanding of the behavior of a closed loop\\n\\ngeothermal system, answers to several key scientific questions are warranted. The first two pertain\\n\\nto the core aspects of modeling:\\n\\n(Q1) What should be the appropriate size of the computational domain for a given vascular layout?\\n\\n(Q2) What are the suitable boundary conditions, and how does this choice affect the prediction of\\n\\nthe system’s performance?\\n\\nSustained performance is essential for the successful operation of an AGS. Since the outlet temper-\\n\\nature relates directly to the thermal power production, the third scientific question reads:\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n(Q3) How does the outlet temperature develop over time? Specifically, how does the flow rate\\n\\ninfluence the initial ascent, the time to reach the peak, and the long-term behavior?\\n\\nOn the practical front, predicting the top surface temperature will be valuable to stakeholders and\\n\\npolicymakers. Ergo, the fourth and final question is:\\n\\n(Q4) How does the temperature field vary on the top surface change over time?\\n\\nThis paper adeptly answers these questions, thereby offering a modeling capability as well as\\n\\nconspicuous insights into the behavior of a geothermal system.\\n\\nHere is the plan for the rest of this paper. We outline the features of a typical closed-loop\\n\\ngeothermal system, provide the problem setup, and discuss the leading vascular layouts (§2). Next,\\nwe present the governing equations of the proposed reduced-order model (ROM) alongside the weak\\n\\nfinite element formulation (§3). Following that, we offer a mathematical analysis showing that the\\n\\nsolutions under the proposed model are unique (§4). Then, using the proposed ROM and finite\\n\\nelement numerical framework, we present numerical solutions that encompass a convergence study\\n\\nand impact of boundary conditions (§5). Subsequently, we analyze the efficiency of geothermal\\n\\nsystems from two perspectives: outlet temperature and power production (§6). Further, using the\\n\\nnumerical solutions, we study the mean surface temperature of the area near a geothermal system\\n\\n(§7). Finally, we provide the discussion and conclude the paper by highlighting the main findings\\n\\nand contributions and suggesting possible research extensions (§8).\\n\\nFigure 1. A geothermal system: The figure illustrates a standard closed-loop geothermal\\n\\nsystem. A coolant, typically water, circulates through an underground network of channels\\n\\nat depths ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 feet, extracting hot water. This heated water under-\\n\\ngoes a heat exchange process, transforming into steam. Utilizing this steam, the geothermal\\n\\nfacility generates electricity by propelling a turbine. An electric grid facilitated by a network\\n\\nof transmission towers distributes the produced electricity to urban centers. The process\\n\\nreleases warm water, which undergoes additional cooling in a dedicated cooling tower, be-\\n\\ncoming available for other energy consumption (e.g., heating and cooling, agriculture, etc).\\n\\nAdditionally, the figure highlights a collaborative approach involving a solar and wind farm\\n\\nto address the region’s energy demand.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n2. VASCULAR LAYOUTS AND PROBLEM SETUP\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a geothermal system comprises a gamut of operating machinery (e.g., cir-\\n\\nculation pump, cooling tower, heat exchanger, electric grid, to name a few) stationed on the surface\\n\\nand a vascular layout beneath the surface, with the inlet and outlet on the horizon. Flowing water\\n\\n(a candidate coolant in geothermal applications) drives the whole heat extraction: A circulation\\n\\npump pushes water to enter the subsurface at the inlet. The injected water flows through the inter-\\n\\nmediate channel layout and extracts heat along its flow path from the nearby subsurface. Finally,\\n\\nthe heated water exits the subsurface from the outlet.\\n\\nThis paper examines two popular vascular designs, depicted in Fig. 2. The U-shaped vascular\\n\\nlayout represents a basic channel setup devoid of branching, yet it offers robust performance [Sun\\n\\net al., 2018]. This vasculature (Σ) comprises two vertical channels linked by a single horizontal\\n\\nchannel, forming a U-shaped structure, as shown in Fig. 2A. The inlet is at the start of one of the\\n\\nvertical branches, while the outlet is at the end of the other. The figure also shows the unit tangent\\n\\nvector along the vasculature, denoted by t̂(x), and the unit outward normal vectors on either side\\n\\nof a vesicle, represented by n̂±(x).\\n\\nThe comb-shaped vascular layout, also popular as Eavor-loop 2.0, is currently considered to be\\n\\nthe state-of-the-art geothermal configuration [Beckers and Johnston, 2022]. This layout is increas-\\n\\ningly favored because its branching structure covers a larger surface area, significantly enhancing\\n\\nthe efficiency of heating the coolant. The concomitant vasculature comprises two vertical legs\\n\\ninterconnected by multiple branches, as depicted in Fig. 2B.\\n\\nA) B)\\ninlet outlet inlet outlet\\n\\n<latexit

2. Vascular layouts: This graphic depicts two commonly utilized vascular configu-\\n\\nrations, both in practical applications and within the context of this paper: A) a U-shaped\\n\\nlayout devoid of branching, and B) a comb-shaped arrangement featuring branches. Σ de-\\n\\nnotes the vascular layout, t̂(x) the unit tangent vector pointing toward increasing arc-length\\n\\nalong the vasculature, and n̂±(x) the unit outward normal vectors on either side of the vas-\\n\\nculature. The fluid (coolant) enters the domain at the inlet and exits at the outlet. As the\\n\\nfluid travels through the length of the vasculature, it extracts heat from the surrounding\\n\\nsubsurface, leading to an increase in its thermal energy—either raising the temperature or\\n\\nlatent heat.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the rest of this paper, we study the performance of these two popular channel designs in\\n\\nextracting thermal energy from the subsurface using modeling.\\n\\n3. A GEOTHERMAL MATHEMATICAL MODEL\\n\\nWe present a mathematical model that predicts the temperature in the subsurface, along the\\n\\nvasculature, and at the outlet. The proposed model is an extension of our previous efforts on\\n\\nthermal regulation in microvascular composites [Nakshatrala, 2023; Nakshatrala et al., 2023]. Some\\n\\nmodeling elements are similar; nevertheless, there are notable differences.\\n\\nOur prior studies on microvascular composites considered slender bodies (i.e., thickness is\\n\\nvery small compared to other characteristic dimensions); therefore, we pursued a two-dimensional\\n\\nreduced-order model in that application. Such a slenderness assumption is not applicable for\\n\\ngeothermal systems (e.g., see the comb-shaped vascular layout given in Figs. 1 and 2)—geothermal\\n\\nsystems span kilometers in all directions. Accordingly, we develop a three-dimensional model for\\n\\ngeothermal applications. Nonetheless, noting that the channel cross section is very small compared\\n\\nto the length of the vascular layout and the dimensions of the domain, we still treat the vascula-\\n\\nture as a curve, but now as a space curve (i.e., a curve in three dimensions). Also, the boundary\\n\\nconditions are different. In the case of microvascular composites application, the boundaries are\\n\\nadiabatic. In the geothermal application, the lateral and bottom boundaries are prescribed with a\\n\\ntemperature field, increasing with depth, while the top surface is free to convect and radiate.\\n\\nConsider a domain Ω ⊂ R3, bounded by a piece-wise smooth boundary ∂Ω. Mathematically,\\n\\n∂Ω := Ω \\\\ Ω (1)\\n\\nin which an overline denotes the set closure. Let x ∈ Ω depict a spatial point, and t ∈ [0, T ] the time,\\n\\nwith T denoting the length of the time interval of interest. ∂(·)/∂t represents the partial derivative\\nin time, and div[·] and grad[·] the spatial divergence and gradient operators, respectively. ϑ(x, t),\\n\\na time-dependent scalar field, represents temperature at a spatial point x and time t. Likewise,\\n\\nq(x, t) is a time-dependent vector field representing the heat flux vector.\\n\\nThe external boundary is divided into three complementary parts: Γϑ, Γq, and ΓN. That is,\\n\\nΓϑ ∪ Γq ∪ ΓN = ∂Ω (2)\\n\\nand\\n\\nΓϑ ∩ Γq = ∅, Γq ∩ ΓN = ∅, and ΓN ∩ Γϑ = ∅ (3)\\n\\nΓϑ is the part of the boundary on which temperature (i.e., Dirichlet boundary condition) is pre-\\n\\nscribed, while Γq is that part of the boundary on which the normal component of the heat flux\\n\\n(i.e., Neumann boundary condition) is prescribed. ΓN is the portion of the boundary that is free to\\n\\nconvect and radiate. We use the Stefan-Boltzmann model for radiation, which makes the boundary\\n\\ncondition nonlinear (cf. Eq. (7e)).\\n\\nThe domain comprises a vasculature Σ—a connected wellbore within the subsurface with the\\n\\ninlet and outlet on the surface. s denotes the arc-length along the vasculature, starting from the\\n\\ninlet and ending at the outlet. t̂(x) represents the unit tangent vector along the vasculature; see\\n\\n[Nakshatrala et al., 2023, SI] for a mathematical definition of the tangent vector. We avail the\\n\\njump and average operators to mathematically describe the continuity of the solution field and the\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\nbalance of energy across the vasculature. Given a scalar field α(x, t) and a vector field a(x, t), the\\n\\njump operator is defined as follows:\\n\\nJα(x, t)K = α+(x, t) n̂+(x) + α−(x, t) n̂−(x) (4a)\\n\\nJa(x, t)K = a+(x, t) • n̂+(x) + a−(x, t) • n̂−(x) (4b)\\n\\nwhere ± denotes the limits of the fields from either side of Σ. For these fields, the average operator\\n\\nis defined as follows:\\n\\n{{α(x, t)K = 1\\n\\n2\\n\\n(\\nα+(x, t) + α−(x, t)\\n\\n)\\n(5a)\\n\\n{{a(x, t)}} =\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n(\\na+(x, t) + a−(x, t)\\n\\n)\\n(5b)\\n\\nThe following property satisfied by the jump and average operators will be handy in establishing\\n\\nthe uniqueness of solutions:[[\\nα(x, t)a(x, t)\\n\\n]]\\n= {{α(x, t)}}\\n\\n[[\\na(x, t)\\n\\n]]\\n+\\n[[\\nα(x, t)\\n\\n]]\\n• {{a(x, t)}} (6)\\n\\nFor more details on jump and average operators, refer to [Nakshatrala and Adhikari, 2024].\\n\\nThe governing equations take the following form:\\n\\nρs cs\\n∂ϑ(x, t)\\n\\n∂t\\n+ div\\n\\n[\\nq(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n= 0 in Ω (7a)\\n\\nq(x, t) = −K(x) grad\\n[\\nϑ(x, t)\\n\\n]\\nin Ω (7b)\\n\\nϑ(x, t) = ϑp(x, t) on Γϑ (7c)\\n\\nq(x, t) • n̂(x) = qp(x, t) on Γq (7d)\\n\\nq(x, t) • n̂(x) = hT\\n(\\nϑ(x, t)− ϑamb\\n\\n)\\n+ ε σ\\n\\n(\\nϑ4(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\namb\\n\\n)\\non ΓN (7e)\\n\\nJϑ(x, t)K = 0 on Σ (7f)\\n\\nJq(x, t)K = ṁ cf grad[ϑ(x, t)] • t̂(x) on Σ (7g)\\n\\nϑ(x, 0) = ϑinitial(x) in Ω (7h)\\n\\nϑ(x, t)\\n∣∣\\ns=0\\n\\n= ϑinlet at inlet (7i)\\n\\nwhere ρs and cs are the density and specific heat capacity of the host solid, respectively. K(x) is the\\n\\nconductivity of the host solid. n̂(x) is the unit outward normal vector. hT denotes the heat transfer\\n\\ncoefficient, ε the emissivity, and σ ≈ 5.67× 10−8 Wm−2K−4 the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. ϑamb\\n\\nis the ambient temperature.\\n\\nThe fluid’s mass flow rate is denoted by\\n\\nṁ = ρf Q (8)\\n\\nwhere Q is the volumetric flow rate and ρf the fluid’s density. The heat capacity rate is defined as\\n\\nχ = ṁ cf (9)\\n\\nin which cf represents the specific heat capacity of the fluid.\\n\\nEquation (7a) represents the energy balance, while Eq. (7b) is the Fourier law of heat conduc-\\n\\ntion. Equations (7c) and (7d) depict the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, respectively,\\n\\nand Eq. (7e) is the non-linear boundary condition accounting for the convection (based on New-\\n\\nton’s law of cooling) and radiation (based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Equations (7f) and (7g)\\n\\nare the jump conditions, describing the temperature continuity and the balance of heat flux across\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\nthe vasculature, respectively. Equation (7h) denotes the initial condition with ϑinitial representing\\n\\nthe prescribed initial temperature. Equation (7i) is the prescription of the temperature at the inlet,\\n\\nwhich is equal to the ambient temperature (i.e., ϑinlet = ϑamb).\\n\\nThe resulting governing equations form a nonlinear second-order parabolic initial boundary\\n\\nvalue problem. The nonlinearity arises due to the the radiation term present in the boundary\\n\\ncondition (7e)\\n\\n3.1. Coefficient of performance. To quantify the performance of a geothermal system, we\\n\\nconsider the following coefficient of performance:\\n\\nζ(t) = 1− ϑinlet\\n\\nϑoutlet(t)\\n(10)\\n\\nwhere the ϑinlet is the prescribed temperature at the inlet, and ϑoutlet(t) is the outlet temperature—a\\n\\ntime varying quantity. Thus, the higher the outlet temperature, the higher the performance.\\n\\n3.2. Weak formulation. For obtaining numerical solutions, we have employed the finite ele-\\n\\nment method (FEM) based on the single-field Galerkin formulation. We denote the weighting (or\\n\\ntest) function by ξ(x) and define the associated function spaces as follows:\\n\\nUt :=\\n{\\nϑ(x, t) ∈ H1(Ω)\\n\\n∣∣ ϑ(x, t) = ϑp(x, t) on Γϑ and ϑ(x, t)\\n∣∣\\ns=0\\n\\n= ϑinlet\\n\\n}\\n(11)\\n\\nW :=\\n{\\nξ(x) ∈ H1(Ω)\\n\\n∣∣ ξ(x) = 0 on Γϑ and ξ(x)\\n∣∣\\ns=0\\n\\n= 0\\n}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nwhere H1(Ω) is a standard Hilbert space [Brezzi and Fortin, 2012]. The Galerkin weak formulation\\n\\nreads: Find ϑ(x, t) ∈ Ut such that we have∫\\nΩ\\nρs cs ξ(x)\\n\\n∂ϑ(x, t)\\n\\n∂t\\ndΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\ngrad[ξ(x)] •K(x) grad[ϑ(x, t)] dΩ\\n\\n+\\n\\n∫\\nΣ\\nχ ξ(x) grad[ϑ(x, t)] • t̂(x) dΓ\\n\\n+\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nξ(x)\\n(\\nhT\\n\\n(\\nϑ(x, t)− ϑamb\\n\\n)\\n+ ε σ\\n\\n(\\nϑ4(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\namb\\n\\n))\\ndΓ\\n\\n= −\\n∫\\nΓq\\n\\nξ(x) qp(x, t) dΓ ∀ξ(x) ∈ W (13)\\n\\nWe have implemented the above weak formulation using the “Weak Form PDE” capability\\n\\navailable in COMSOL [COMSOL Multiphysics, 2018]. This feature in COMSOL approximates\\n\\nthe user-provided weak form using the FEM for spatial discretization and the backward difference\\n\\nformula (BDF) for temporal discretization. We have used second-order Lagrange elements and\\n\\nBDF with a minimum order of one to a maximum of five.\\n\\n4. UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS\\n\\nBefore we report numerical results, it is imperative to assess whether the model actually renders\\n\\nunique solutions. What we show in this section is that the solutions are unique when radiation is\\n\\nneglected, while only the “non-negative” solutions are unique when the radiation is present. We\\n\\nfirst present the relevant notation and preparatory remarks that make the derivation succinct.\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the contrary, if the solutions are not unique, then there exist two time-dependent fields\\n\\nϑ1(x, t) and ϑ2(x, t) each satisfying the governing equations (7a)–(7h). Consequently, their differ-\\n\\nence\\n\\nw(x, t) := ϑ1(x, t)− ϑ2(x, t) (14)\\n\\nsatisfies the following initial boundary value problem:\\n\\nρs cs\\n∂w(x, t)\\n\\n∂t\\n− div\\n\\n[\\nK(x) grad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]]\\n= 0 in Ω (15a)\\n\\nw(x, t) = 0 on Γϑ (15b)\\n\\n−n̂(x) •K(x) grad\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n= 0 on Γq (15c)\\n\\n−n̂(x) •K(x) grad\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n= hT w(x, t) + ε σ\\n\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\n\\non ΓN (15d)\\n\\nJw(x, t)K = 0 on Σ (15e)\\n\\n−\\nq\\nK(x) grad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]y\\n= ṁ cf grad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n• t̂(x) on Σ (15f)\\n\\nw(x, 0) = 0 in Ω (15g)\\n\\nw(x, t)\\n∣∣\\ns=0\\n\\n= 0 at inlet (15h)\\n\\nThus, to establish uniqueness, it suffices to show that w(x, t) = 0 is the only solution to the\\n\\nabove initial boundary value problem (15a)–(15h). The next two theorems precisely show that the\\n\\ndifference w(x, t) vanishes by considering two separate cases: with and without radiation.\\n\\nTheorem 4.1 (Uniqueness neglecting radiation). Without radiation (i.e., ε = 0), solutions\\n\\nunder the mathematical model are unique.\\n\\nProof. Multiplying Eq. (15a) with w(x, t) and integrating over the domain, we get:∫\\nΩ\\nw(x, t) ρs cs\\n\\n∂w(x, t)\\n\\n∂t\\ndΩ−\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\nw(x, t) div\\n\\n[\\nK(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]\\ndΩ = 0 (16)\\n\\nNoting that ρs and cs are independent of the temperature and time, we write:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ−\\n∫\\nΩ\\nw(x, t) div\\n\\n[\\nK(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]\\ndΩ = 0 (17)\\n\\nApplying the Green’s identity to the second term in the above equation, we have:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\ngrad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n•K(x) grad[w(x, t)] dΩ\\n\\n−\\n∫\\n∂Ω\\n\\nw(x, t) n̂(x) •K(x) grad[w(x, t)] dΓ\\n\\n−\\n∫\\nΣ\\n\\n[[\\nw(x, t)K(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]]\\ndΓ = 0 (18)\\n\\nWe note that the boundary ∂Ω is decomposed into Γϑ, Γq and ΓN. Invoking Eqs. (15b)–(15d) to\\n\\nsimplify the third term in the above equation, we arrive at the following:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\ngrad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n•K(x) grad[w(x, t)] dΩ\\n\\n+\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nhT w2(x, t) dΓ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n−\\n∫\\nΣ\\n\\n[[\\nw(x, t)K(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]]\\ndΓ = 0 (19)\\n\\nSince K(x) is positive definite, the second integral in the above equation is non-negative. The\\n\\nthird integral is also non-negative as hT ≥ 0 and w2(x, t) ≥ 0. We, therefore, end up with the\\n\\nfollowing inequality:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ\\n\\n−\\n∫\\nΣ\\n\\n[[\\nw(x, t)K(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]]\\ndΓ ≤ 0 (20)\\n\\nApplying the property given by Eq. (6) to the third term, we get:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ\\n\\n−\\n∫\\nΣ\\n{{w(x, t)}\\n\\n[[\\nK(x) grad[w(x, t)]\\n\\n]]\\ndΓ\\n\\n−\\n∫\\nΣ\\n\\n[[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]]\\n• {{K(x) grad[w(x, t)]}}dΓ ≤ 0 (21)\\n\\nThe jump condition (15e) implies that the fourth term vanishes. Further, using the other jump\\n\\ncondition (15f) in the third term, we write:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ\\n\\n+\\n\\n∫\\nΣ\\nṁ cf {{w(x, t)}} grad\\n\\n[\\nw(x, t)\\n\\n]\\n• t̂(x) dΓ ≤ 0 (22)\\n\\nNoting that ṁ and cf are constants, integrating the third term along the vasculature, and using\\n\\nEq.

Eq. (26)) is\\n\\nnon-negative—ρs and cs are positive, and w2(x, t) is a non-negative field. This discourse implies\\n\\nthat\\n\\nE(t) = 0 (30)\\n\\nwhich further implies that\\n\\nw(x, t) = 0 ∀x,∀t (31)\\n\\nNoting that w(x, t) := ϑ1(x, t)−ϑ2(x, t), we have established the uniqueness of the solutions in the\\n\\nabsence of radiation. □\\n\\nTheorem 4.2 (Uniqueness considering radiation). With radiation (i.e., ε ̸= 0), the non-\\n\\nnegative solutions under the mathematical model are unique.\\n\\nProof. Most of the steps remain the same as in Theorem 4.1. We take up from Eq. (24):\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ4\\n1(x, t)− ϑ4\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ ≤ 0 (32)\\n\\nExpanding the integrand in the second integral and noting that w(x, t) := ϑ1(x, t) − ϑ2(x, t), we\\n\\nwrite:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ +\\n\\n∫\\nΓN\\n\\nw2(x, t) ε σ\\n(\\nϑ1(x, t) + ϑ2(x, t)\\n\\n) (\\nϑ2\\n1(x, t) + ϑ2\\n\\n2(x, t)\\n)\\ndΓ ≤ 0 (33)\\n\\nSince ϑ1(x, t) and ϑ2(x, t) are non-negative solutions, ϑ1(x, t) + ϑ2(x, t) ≥ 0. Also, the term\\n\\nϑ2\\n1(x, t) + ϑ2\\n\\n2(x, t) is patently non-negative. Further noting that ε ≥ 0 and σ > 0, we conclude that\\n\\nthe second integral is non-negative, yielding:\\n\\nd\\n\\ndt\\n\\n∫\\nΩ\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nρs csw\\n\\n2(x, t) dΩ ≤ 0 (34)\\n\\nThe above inequality is the same as in Eq.

Test problem. A) The domain is a cuboid of size Lx × Ly × Lz, featuring a\\n\\nvascular layout within its subsurface. The top face is free to convect and radiate, while the\\n\\nremaining faces (i.e., lateral and bottom faces) are subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition\\n\\n(BC). B) The prescribed temperature increases linearly with depth at a slope of m.\\n\\nthe temperature (ϑ) increases linearly with the depth (z). Mathematically, we write this variation\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\nϑ = mz + ϑamb (35)\\n\\nwhere m is the slope of the variation (geothermal gradient), and ϑamb the ambient temperature.\\n\\nWe use this variation to prescribe the initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Table 1 provides\\n\\nthe parameters used in the numerical simulations.\\n\\n5.1. Domain size. The selection of domain size depends on accurately capturing solution\\n\\nfields while managing computational costs. An obvious aspect of computational cost is the time\\n\\nrequired to obtain the solution. Additionally, modeling the Earth’s surface, including buried chan-\\n\\nnels, can make mesh creation both costly and time-intensive. Thus, determining an appropriate\\n\\ndomain size that meets these requirements is crucial. This section aims to do just that.\\n\\nTo make the idea more tangible, we consider a domain of depth d = 10 km, comprising a U-\\n\\nshaped vascular layout with a constant channel spacing of s = 3 km. Both the length Lx and width\\n\\nLy of the domain are determined by a constant multiplier of the spacing, denoted as α s, resulting\\n\\nin Lx = Ly = s+2α s. With α ranging from 0.5 to 2, this corresponds to a variation in length and\\n\\nwidth from 6 to 15 km. To examine the impact of domain size on the solution field, temperature\\n\\ndata is plotted along a horizontal line at a depth of 0.7d in the plane below the horizontal segment of\\n\\nthe vascular layout, at the 63-year mark; see Fig. 4. The length normalization takes the following\\n\\nmathematical form:\\n\\nNormalized length =\\nx\\n\\ns\\n− (α+ 0.5) (36)\\n\\nwhere x is any point on the horizontal line.\\n\\nThe key criterion is that the domain size is deemed appropriate as long as the boundaries of\\n\\nthe domain do not affect the solution field. When the value of α decreases from 2 to 0.5, the plots\\n\\nindicate that the solution fields converge and remain unaffected by the boundaries. The temperature\\n\\nremains consistent except for the two peaks occurring at the intersection of the horizontal line and\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1.

A zoomed-in section of the plot further illustrates that, aside\\n\\nfrom the areas near the channels, the temperature across other parts remains uniform. Therefore, in\\n\\nresponse to our first scientific question (Q1), we conclude that α = 0.5 (i.e., domain size Lx = Ly =\\n\\n6 km) can achieve a reliable numerical solution. Thus this value is used in all further studies.\\n\\n5.2. Effect of boundary conditions. We explore how the choice of boundary conditions\\n\\nimpacts the solution field, specifically the outlet temperature in Fig. 5. We observe an invariance\\n\\nbetween the outlet temperature under two boundary conditions: Neumann and Dirichlet. This\\n\\nresemblance might be attributed to the far-field boundaries, meaning they are situated considerably\\n\\nfrom the channel through which the fluid flows. To simulate geothermal systems, our domain size\\n\\nshould be large enough so that the boundary conditions do not significantly influence our solution\\n\\nfield. The findings verify that the selected domain size for the geothermal system is robust, and\\n\\nthe choice of boundary conditions does not influence the system’s efficiency, answering our second\\n\\nscience question (Q2).\\n\\n5.3. Temperature profile. In Fig. 6, we illustrate the temperature profile of the geothermal\\n\\nsystems modeled in this study, aiming to enhance the readers’ understanding. The profiles depicted\\n\\ncorrespond to the two vascular layouts outlined in Sect. 2.

We consider a domain with depth d and a horizontal\\n\\ndimension of (1 + 2α)s, where s represents the spacing of the injection and production\\n\\nchannels. For various values of α ranging from 0.5 to 2, we plotted the temperature at\\n\\na depth of 0.7d after 63 years of geothermal system operation and for a mass flow rate\\n\\nof 35 kg/s. The solution profile remains mostly consistent within the chosen range of α.\\n\\nInference: As a result, we recommend setting the domain size to be twice the spacing\\n\\nbetween the vertical legs in the vascular layout, corresponding to α = 0.5.\\n\\nof 30 K/km as the depth into the subsurface increases.

OUTLET TEMPERATURE AND EFFICIENCY\\n\\nIn this section, we study the efficiency of geothermal systems, focusing on production capacity—\\n\\na key determinant of whether the system warrants further investigation and real-field application.\\n\\nWhile doing so, we introduce breakdown, as a point of time at which the efficiency drops down\\n\\nfor the system. We first examine the efficiency with respect to the outlet temperature and then\\n\\nanalyze the power production, together answering the third scientific question (Q3).\\n\\n6.1. Outlet temperature. As described in Sect. 2, both vascular layouts involve extracting\\n\\na hot fluid at the outlet. The coefficient of performance of the system, given in Eq. (10), increases\\n\\nwith an increase in the outlet temperature ϑoutlet, as ϑinlet is constant (cf. Eq. (7i)). Consequently,\\n\\na plot of ϑoutlet over time can effectively represent the system’s coefficient of performance. Figure 7\\n\\nillustrates the outlet temperature measurements for both vascular layouts over a 63-year period and\\n\\nunder various mass flow rates. One can make the following inferences from the plot. In the case\\n\\nof the U-shaped layout in Fig. 7A), the peak outlet temperature increases as the mass flow rate\\n\\nincreases reaching as high as 420 K for 30 kg/s. However, lower mass flow rate values, such as 5\\n\\nkg/s and 10 kg/s, do not lead to the system’s breakdown, but the higher mass flow rates cause the\\n\\nbreakdown sooner: 15 kg/s at 10 years, 20 kg/s at 7 years, 25 kg/s at 5 years, and 30 kg/s at 4\\n\\nyears.\\n\\nIn the case of the comb-shaped layout in Fig. 7B), as the mass flow rate increases, the peak\\n\\noutlet temperature also rises, reaching a maximum of 440 K for 30 kg/s. Also, none of the mass\\n\\nflow rates lead to a breakdown, offering a significant advantage over the U-shaped layout and the\\n\\npotential for substantially higher average power production.\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nExterior view\\nInlet Outlet\\n\\nTranslucent view\\n\\nC\\nom\\nb-\\nsh\\nap\\ned\\n\\nU\\n-s\\nha\\npe\\nd\\n\\nSection view\\n\\nInlet Outlet\\n\\nFigure 6. 3D temperature profile: The figure illustrates the temperature profile within\\n\\nclosed-loop geothermal systems for U-shaped (top panel) and comb-shaped (bottom) layouts.\\n\\nThe temperature gradient is 30 K/km, with the temperature of the top surface equal to\\n\\nthe ambient temperature (which is indicated in blue color in the graphics). A coolant\\n\\n(water) at ambient temperature enters the channel at the inlet. As it traverses along the\\n\\nvasculature, the water’s temperature increases due to heat conduction.

Outlet temperature. The figure collates the results from a parametric study on\\n\\nthe temporal evolution of the outlet temperature for different mass flow rates. A) In a U-\\n\\nshaped layout, an increase in mass flow rate leads to a rise in outlet temperature. However,\\n\\na higher mass flow rate results in an earlier breakdown. B) On the other hand, in a comb-\\n\\nshaped layout, the outlet temperature rises with increasing mass flow rates. Notably, none\\n\\nof the curves, for various mass flow rates, reaches a breakdown point within the 63-year time\\n\\nframe. Inference: Given the higher outlet temperature and the absence of breakdown, the\\n\\ncomb-shaped outperforms the U-shaped for higher mass flow rates.\\n\\nFinally, the average power production of the geothermal system is calculated using the following\\n\\nexpression:\\n\\nAverage power =\\n1\\n\\nT\\n\\n∫ T\\n\\n0\\nPower(t) dt (38)\\n\\nFigure 8C illustrates the average power production over 63 years lifetime of both the layouts,\\n\\nshowcasing a wide range of mass flow rate variations, extending up to 60 kg/s. Below are some key\\n\\nobservations from the bar plot:\\n\\n(1) For lower mass flow rates of 5 kg/s and 10 kg/s, the average power of the U-shaped layout\\n\\nexceeds that of the comb-shaped layout. Nonetheless, the amount of average power of both\\n\\nlayouts is not significant for practical field applications.\\n\\n(2) Notably, beyond 25 kg/s, the relative increment in average power production for the U-shaped\\n\\nlayout is negligible, while that of the comb-shaped layout is increasing exponentially.\\n\\n(3) Given the intricate branching and higher depth of the comb-shaped layout, the fluid path delves\\n\\nfurther into the hot subsurface, resulting in significantly higher average power production than\\n\\nthe U-shaped layout.\\n\\n(4) It is noteworthy that the U-shaped layout shows admirable performance up to 20–25 kg/s,\\n\\ngiven its simple shape and ease of field application. However, the comb-shaped layout excels\\n\\nat higher mass flow rates, outperforming the U-shaped layout.\\n\\n7.

However, the\\n\\nU-shaped layout experiences a significant drop in power production around the 10-year mark\\n\\ndue to a breakdown, reducing its output. C) The average power bar chart offers a clear\\n\\nrepresentation of the geothermal system’s efficiency. The U-shaped layout demonstrates\\n\\nbetter performance at lower mass flow rates. However, as the mass flow rate increases,\\n\\nthe comb-shaped layout becomes more efficient, generating approximately four times the\\n\\naverage power of the U-shaped layout at 60 kg/s. Inference: For the U-shaped layout, a\\n\\nlower mass flow rate (no greater than 20–25 kg/s) is preferable, while a higher mass flow\\n\\nrate is recommended for the comb-shaped layout.\\n\\nfrom 100 m to 450 m, were considered, as shown in Fig. 9A.

Effect on mean surface temperature. The figure answers the question: How\\n\\ndoes a working geothermal system affect the mean surface temperature of regions near the\\n\\nextraction well (i.e., the outlet)? A) We considered various regions near the outlet, whose\\n\\ndimensions are given by the edge length (a). We selected five sizes varying from 100 m\\n\\nto 450 m. B) The mean surface temperature is calculated for each region and is plotted\\n\\nover the time since the inception of the production. The mass flow rate is taken as 60\\n\\nkg/s. Inference: For the square region with a = 100 m, a temperature increase of about two\\n\\ndegrees K is noted. For larger regions (i.e., a ≥ 200 m), the rise in mean surface temperature\\n\\nis marginal (less than 1 K).\\n\\n8. DISCUSSION AND CLOSURE\\n\\nWe have presented a novel modeling framework to study the transient response of closed-\\n\\nloop geothermal systems—also referred to as advanced geothermal systems (AGS). The framework\\n\\ncomprises a reduced-order mathematical model, which treats the embedded vasculature as a curve,\\n\\nand an associated numerical formulation based on the finite element method. The significance of\\n\\nour research lies in providing a reliable tool for accurately forecasting the subsurface temperature\\n\\nfield and the outlet temperature, which can be utilized to calculate long-term power production\\n\\nrates and efficiency.\\n\\nIn the realm of geothermal energy, various modeling approaches have been explored for differ-\\n\\nent systems, including EGS and AGS. However, a pivotal question remains: Whether the model is\\n\\npredictive? Posed differently: Are the model’s results reliable? Our ROM model for geothermal\\n\\napplications has been built based on the mathematical model developed for thermal regulation in\\n\\nmicrovascular composites. For that application, which assumed the domain to be slender, Naksha-\\n\\ntrala [2023] has provided the mathematical underpinning, presenting several qualitative properties\\n\\nthat establish the model’s reliability and trustworthiness. Also, in active cooling of microvascular\\n\\ncomposites, the mathematical model has been validated experimentally [Nakshatrala et al., 2023].\\n\\nThis combination of theoretical robustness and practical verification underscores the reliability of\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\nour ROM in the study of geothermal systems. Therefore, our proposed model can be considered\\n\\npredictive.\\n\\nThe mathematical model and numerical results presented in the paper provide a deeper un-\\n\\nderstanding of AGS and aid in perfecting such energy systems, contributing to the development of\\n\\nsustainable green energy solutions on a large scale. Some of the salient features of the proposed\\n\\nmodeling framework are:\\n\\n(S1) The ROM framework provides a quick and accurate prediction of the temperature field, in-\\n\\ncluding the outlet temperature, which is proportional to thermal efficiency.\\n\\n(S2) The model accurately incorporates the jump conditions across the vasculature.\\n\\n(S3) The model enjoys several attractive mathematical properties, including the uniqueness of\\n\\nsolutions.\\n\\n(S4) The framework enables users to determine the system’s performance and optimal capacity.\\n\\nThe main findings of this work are:\\n\\n(C1) For a given spacing between the inlet and outlet branches, the lateral dimensions of the\\n\\ncomputational domain can be taken as twice this distance.\\n\\n(C2) The higher mass flow rates result in higher outlet temperature and, subsequently, higher\\n\\npower production.\\n\\n(C3) The time it takes for the system to reach a peak depends on the mass flow rate.\\n\\n(C4) The efficiency of geothermal systems in terms of average power is calculated. The U-shaped\\n\\nlayout shows better performance at lower mass flow rates, while the comb-shaped layout excels\\n\\nsignificantly at higher mass flow rates.\\n\\n(C5) The study also confirms that geothermal systems do not adversely impact neighboring lands,\\n\\nas demonstrated through an analysis of the mean surface temperature (MST) of the top\\n\\nsurface.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, our findings indicate that lower mass flow rates are more effective with a U-\\n\\nshaped layout, whereas a comb-shaped layout is optimal with higher mass flow rates. However,\\n\\nconsidering the depth and layout design, the comb-shaped layout demands substantially higher\\n\\nresources than the U-shaped layout. By carefully evaluating these factors, stake holders can make\\n\\ninformed decisions to optimize the design and operation of geothermal systems, ultimately achieving\\n\\nmaximum effectiveness and efficiency.\\n\\nFinally, we envision two fronts for potential future work. The first one is to extend the model\\n\\nby incorporating two-phase characteristics of the flowing fluids. This will be particularly important\\n\\nwhen supercritical carbon dioxide is used. The second one is to develop a machine-learning-based\\n\\nmodel that can offer fast forecasting, which is ideal for real-time monitoring of a geothermal system.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nKA and KBN acknowledge the support from the UH-Chevron Energy Fellowship, while MKM\\n\\nthanks the U.S. DOE Geothermal Technologies Office (Award #: DE-EE-3.1.8.1).
